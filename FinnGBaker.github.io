    <h1>History of Video Games</h1>
      <p>Video games are digital games playable on computers, mobile phones, and consoles. Though in recent years they have taken on a much greater meaning, becoming a massive industry, a sport and an educational tool.</p>
      <h2>The Beginning (1950s)</h2>
        <p>Video games as a concept started with electronic toys of the 50s and slowly evolved into what we have today.</p>
      <h2>Video games at home (1960-1983)</p>
        <p>Video games further developed over the next three decades with pinball machines, specificaly Vagabond in 1962 and Space Odyssey in 1976, these would become a staple of arcades that would arise in the coming years.</p>
      <h2>The north american video game crash (1983)</h2>
        <p>Home video consolse begame bigger and bigger in the early 80s, with systems like comedor 64, the colecovision, and the atari.

        <p>After E.T. ruined the gaming industry, Nintendo revived it with the release of the Famicom in japan majorly revived the idustry in japan where it mostly stayed for the next decade. Meanwhile in the west arcades were still popular, and thanks to R.O.B. the robot acting as a trojan horse of sorts, the Nintendo Entertainment system became a massive hit. This is when many of the greatest game series were created. Mario bros, Castlevania, Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, and in the early 90s Sonic the Hedgehog, Final fantasy 6 is best) and Street fighter.</p>
      <h2>Tech company takeover (1995-2010)</2>
        <p>During the mid 90s to the 2000s, major tech companies began to throw there hat into the ring with sony relasing the Playstaion in 1994 and Microsofts Xbox in 2001. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft would dominate the industry for consoles, meanwhile all this time, the Pc gaming scene has greatly advanced the gaming secne, with Blizzard's "Craft" games of Warcraft, Starcraft, and World of Warcraft(WOW) being the very first MMORPG, and starcraft being considered to be the very first Esport.</p>
      <h2>Today in gaming (2010-today)</2>
        <p>Recelty there has been a massive change in gaming with the rise of indie games. Indie games truly began to rise with games like Super meatboy, Fez, Splunky and a bit more recently Undertale and the FNAF series. These were all teams of one or two people making massive hits through brilliant game design and storytelling. We have also seen the rise of esports as something major with games like Overwatch, Smash Bros., and fortnite(but really who cares about that one).</p>
